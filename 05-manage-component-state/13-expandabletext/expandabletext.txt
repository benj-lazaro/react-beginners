Exercise: Building an ExpandableText Component
----------------------------------------------
- Build a component named <ExpandableText /> (ExpandableText.tsx)
    - It accepts long text as content

    - It summarizes the entered text down to 100 characters (by default)
        - This limit can (optionally) confugured using a prop named "maxChars"
        - NOTE: Use "?" besides the prop name 

    - At the end of the text content, it is suffixed with "..."
        - Followed by a button labeled "More"

    - Clicking the button "More"
        - The entire text content is rendered
        - Suffixed with "..."
        - Followed by a button labeled "Less"

    - Clicking the button "Less"
        - Summarizes the text content to its default (or custom) limit of characters


- NOTE: State Hooks is ONLY used for storing values that MIGHT change over time & re-render the component
    - It should NOT be used on values that can be computed from using methods (e.g. substring())
