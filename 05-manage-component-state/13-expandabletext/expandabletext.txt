Building an ExpandableText Component
------------------------------------
- Build a component called ExpandableText
    - Accepts a long text content
    - It summarizes the text
        - By default, it displays the 1st 100 characters
        
        - But can be configured using a prop (optional)
            - maxChars = <max. characters to display>

        - At the end of the text
            - It has the suffix of "..."
            - Followed by a "More" button

        - Clicking the "More" button
            - Diplays the entire text content
            - Followed by a suffix of "..."
            - Then by a "Less" button
            
        - Clicking the "Less" button
            - Summarizes the text down


- NOTE: State Hooks should NOT be used on any value that can be computed (e.g. fullname)
    - It is used ONLY for storing values that MIGHT change over time
    - And the change requires re-rendering a component
