Sharing State between Components
--------------------------------
- When sharing state between (child) components
    - The State Hook MUST be placed on the nearest parent component 
    - The parent component shares the state to its children component using props
    

- All the changes in the state SHOULD be done in the parent component
    - The component that holds the state (i.e. parent component) 
        - Is the one responsible for updating it
