Updating Arrays
---------------
- The concept of updating the state of an object applies to an array
    

- To add an element into the primary array
    - Instead of working directly on the primary array
        
    - Use the 2nd parameter method
        - Pass a new array as argument
        - Use the spread operator (...) to copy the contents of the primary array
        - Followed by the new item to be added into the new array


- To remove an element from the primary array
    - Instead of working directly on the primary array
        
    - Use the 2nd parameter method
        - Call the .filter() method on the primary array

        - Pass an arrow function as an argument value to .filter()
            - Pass an argument variable (representing an array element)
            - In the body of the function
                - The value in the argument variable !== targeted element to be removed

    
- To update an element on the primary array
    - Instead of working directly on the primary array
        
    - Use the 2nd parameter method
        - Call the .map() method on the primary array
            - NOTE: There are other ways; this is the preference of the author

        - Pass an arrow function as an argument value to .map()
            - Pass an argument variable (representing an array element)
            - In the body of the function
                - Implement an ternary operation
                - If the value of the argument variable === targeted element to be updated
                    - Then update it with a new value
                    - Otherwise assign the same value of the argument variable
