Understanding the Strict Mode
-----------------------------
- Strict mode helps catch potential problems (e.g. impure components)
    - This is ENABLED by DEFAULT starting React 18
    - This is validated by the following line of code in "main.tsx"    

        ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
            <React.StrictMode>
                <App />
            </React.StrictMode>
        );

    - This enables React to RENDER components TWICE in development mode
        - 1st render    = detect potential issues in the code
        - 2nd render    = update the user interface (UI)

    - When building the app for production
        - The Strict mode checks will NOT be included
        - Components will RENDER only ONCE


- The <React.StrictMode> is a built-in component in React
    - It does NOT have a visual representation
    - It's ONLY purpose is to catch potential problems (e.g. impure components)
