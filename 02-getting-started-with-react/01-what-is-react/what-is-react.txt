What is React?
--------------
- React is a JavaScript library
    - That is used for building dynamic & interactive user interfaces (UI)
    - Created by Facebook (now Meta) in 2011
    - Currently, the most used library of Front-end development


- Why was React created
    - When as a web app is loaded on the browser
        - The browser parses through the HTML code 
        - Simultaneously creates a tree-like structure referred to as the DOM (Document Object Model)
        - The DOM allows to use JavaScript (w/o 3rd party tools)
            - To change / update a web page's content, in response to a user's action
        
        - As a web app grows
            - Working with the DOM becomes more complex and challenging to manage 

        - With React
            - There is no longer a need to worry about updating the DOM elements
            - React "describes" a web app using small reusable components
            - These components take care of creating and updating corresponding DOM elements


- React components
    - They help write reusable, module and better organized code
        

- React application
    - It is essentially a tree of React components
        - With "App" being the root 
        - That brings everything (individual React component) together
