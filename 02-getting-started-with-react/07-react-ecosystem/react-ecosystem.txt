React Ecosystem
---------------
- React is a JavaScript library 
    - Specifically for building dynamic & interactive user interfaces 
    
    - Often will require additional 3rd-party tools for other tasks:
        - Routing users from one page to another
        - Making HTTP calls
        - Manaing application state
        - Internationalization
        - Form validations
        - Animations

    - React does NOT have an opinion on the additional 3rd party tools
        - Providing the freedom to choose the right tools for the job

    
- A library is a tool that provides SPECIFIC functionality
    - While a framework is a set of tools & guidelines for building applications
    - Both Angular and Vue are frameworks
