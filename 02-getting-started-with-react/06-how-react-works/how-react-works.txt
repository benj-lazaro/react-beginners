How React Works
---------------
- When a React application starts
    - The React library takes a tree of components

    - Builds a JavaScript data structure called the "Virtual DOM"
        - This is a lightweight in-memory representation of the component tree
        - This is different from the actual DOM in the browser

    - When the state or the data of a react component changes
        - React updates the corresponding node in the Virtual DOM to reflect the new state

    - Compares the current version of the Virtual DOM with the previous version
        - To identify which nodes that should be updated

    - Updates the identified nodes in the actual DOM


- In browser-based apps
    - Updating the DOM is done by a companion library ReactDOM
    - This can be viewed in the generated "/src/main.tsx" file


- In mobile apps
    - React Native uses native components to render the user interface
