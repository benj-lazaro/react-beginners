Understanding HTTP Requests
---------------------------
- What happens under the hood when calling the method ".get()" of the Axios library
    - Axios sends an HTTP request to the remote server
        - HTTP = stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol"
        - A protocol for transferring data over the Internet

    - The remote server responds with an HTTP response 
        - This contains HTML, CSS and other resources
        - Needed to render the requested content (e.g. web page) on the browser

    - In HTTP, every request & response has two (2) sections
        - Header
            - Specifies the metadata

        - Body
            - Gets the data

    - Launch Chrome
    
    - Launch Chrome Dev Tools (CTRL + SHIFT + I)
