Effect Clean Up
---------------
- Sometimes the code passed to the "Effect Hook" requires a clean Up
    - A "clean up" undo whatever the "Effect Hook" was doing


- To provide a "clean up" to the function that is passed to an "Effect Hook"
    - Inside the function
    
    - Declare a "return" statement
        - Followed by an anonymous arrow function

    - Inside the arrow function
        - Call the function that contains the "clean up" code
    
    - NOTE: This is NOT always necessary


- In the exam code
    - Open the <App /> component (App.tsx)

    - Create two functions to "simulate" a connection & disconnection to a remote server
        - Returns a message on the browser's JavaScript console

        const connect = () => console.log("Connecting");
        const disconnect = () => console.log("Disconnecting");


    - Create an effect using the function "useEffect()"
        - That calls the function "connect()" after the <App /> component is rendered on the DOM

        useEffect(() => {
            connect();

        });

    - Inside the "effect", add the "clean up"
        - Declare a "return" statement

        - Followed by an anonymous arrow function

        - Inside the arrow function
            - Calls the function "disconnect()"

        useEffect(() => {
            connect();

            return () => disconnect();
        })            
            
        - NOTE: The "clean up" is executed when the <App /> component is unmounted from the DOM
    

    - Save the changes
        - Vite reloads the React application

        - On the browser's JavaScript console
            - The message "Connecting" is displayed
            
            - Then followed by the "Disconnecting" message
            
                - NOTE: The "clean up" code is called after the <App /> component gets unmounted from the DOM
                - The React application gets executed in "Strict Mode"
                - The <App /> component gets rendered twice

            - Lastly the message "Connecting" is displayed
