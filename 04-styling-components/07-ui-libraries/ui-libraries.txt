Popular UI Libraries
--------------------
- UI libraries that help quickly build beautiful & modern applications
    - Bootstrap
        - It gives a bunch of useful components & really easy to use

    - Material UI
        - It is an open-source React component library that influenced Google's material design
            - The design language used in Google products

        - Use theses components to ships products (apps) faster
            - Instead all of the styles by hand

    - Tailwind CSS
        - It is a utility-first CSS framework
            - Instead of fully-fleshed component
            - It gives a bunch of small utility classes used for styling components

        - As the styles of a component gets more complicated
            - The component's JSX mark-up will end up with a lot of utility classes

            - It is very easy to learn
