Popular UI Libraries
--------------------
- Among the popular UI libraries that help quickly build beautiful & modern apps
    - Bootstrap
        - Offers a bunch of useful components
        - Really easy to use

    - Material UI
        - An open-source React component library
        - It has influenced Google's material design
        - It is the design language used in Google products
        - It help to ship products (apps) faster instead of writing UI by hand

    - Tailwind CSS
        - A utility-first CSS framework
        - It provides a bunch of small utility classes for styling components
            - Instead of fully-fleshed UI components
        
        - It eliminates the need to write CSS by hand

        - However, as the styles get more complicated
            - The component's markup ends up with a lot of utility classes

    - Daisy UI
        - Provides fully-fleshed components with cleaner markup
        - A good alternative to Tailwind CSS

    - Chakra UI
        - A React component library built on top of Tailwind CSS
            - Similar to Material UI
            - BUT NOT as comprehensive
            - It has all the essential UI components
            - It is very easy to learn
            - Will be used on the course's projects
