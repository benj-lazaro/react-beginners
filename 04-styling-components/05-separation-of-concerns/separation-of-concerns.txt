Separation of Concerns
----------------------
- Separation of concerns is an important software design principle
    - Divide a program into distinct sections (functional areas)
    - Each section handles a specific functionality
    - Than have eveything in one place


- This will make an app
    - Modular
        - Build and test modules independently
        - Reuse modules in other programs
        - Each module is responsible for a SINGLE concern
        - Implementation is hidden behind a well-defined interface

    - Easier to understand
    - Easier to maintain
    - Easier to modify
