Separation of Concerns
----------------------
- Separation of concerns is an important design principle in software engineering
    - It recommends to divide a program into distinct sections
    - Each section handle a specific functionality
    - Rather than have eveything in one place 


- Applying this principle make an to be
    - Modular
        - Build & test modules independently
        - Re-use modules in other program
        - Each module is responsible for a single concern
        - Implementation is hidden behind a well-defined interface 

    - Easier to understand
    - Easier to maintain
    - Easirt to modify
