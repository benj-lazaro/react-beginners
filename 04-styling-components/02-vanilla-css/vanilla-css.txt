Vanilla CSS
-----------
- First approach for styling React components is using vanilla (or plain) CSS
    - NOT recommended due to the available of useful 3rd-party libraries
        - Bootstrap
        - Material UI

    - Writing it all by hand is time consuming and tedious


- On the example code
    - Before styling the <ListGroup /> component using vanilla CSS

    - Disable the previously imported Bootstrap library
        - Open the folder "src"

        - Open the file "main.tsx"

        - Delete the associated "import" statement

    - Save the changes
        - All of the stlying had been stripped off from the <ListGroup /> component


- To stlyle the <ListGroup /> component from scratch using vanilla CSS
    - In the folder "src/components"
        - Create a new folder named "ListGroup"
        
    - Open the folder "ListGroup"
        - Create a new CSS file named "ListGroup.css"
        - Then move the <ListGroup /> component (ListGroup.tsx) into the folder "ListGroup"

    - Open the <ListGroup /> component (ListGroup.tsx)
        - Import the CSS file "ListGroup.css"

            import "./ListGroup.css";

        - Save the changes

    - Open the file "ListGroup.css"
        - Declare a class selector named "list-group"
            - Set the property "list-style" to the value of "none"
            - Set the property "padding" to 0

                .list-group {
                    list-style: none;
                    padding: 0;
                }

        - Save the changes
            - The React app broke due to the move of the <ListGroup /> component to a different folder
            - Resulting to the <App /> component's import statement NOT working anymore


- To address this concern
    - Inside the folder "ListGroup"

    - Create new file named "index.ts"

    - Open the file "index.ts"
        - Import the folder "ListGroup"
        - Then export "ListGroup" as a default object

            import ListGroup from "./ListGroup";
                
            export default ListGroup

    - Save the changes
        
        - The file "index.ts" functions as an index file 
            - Located within a component's folder

        - When the TypeScript compiler references a missing file on the <App /> component's "import" statement
            - Searches for the file "index.ts" inside the corresponding component's folder
            - Opens the file
            - Checks for exported default object(s)

    - Move back to the <App /> component
        - Use the "import" statement to reference the folder "ListGroup"

            import ListGroup from "./components/ListGroup";

    - Save the changes
        - React app now working
        - Rendered items from the <ListGroup /> component does NOT have bulletpoints
        - Padding around each list item is removed
