Inline Styles
-------------
- CSS inline styles can also be used for styling components
    - Similar to how they are implemeneted in HTML documents

    - Uses the JSX element's prop "style"
        - Similar to that of the HTML element's "style" attribute

        - The CSS property is named using camelcase convention
            - e.g. "background-color" to "backgroundColor"

        - The value is expressed as an object instead of a string
            - Enclosed within a pair of {..}

            - The object can also be defined outside the JSX markup

                <ul className="list-group" style={{ backgroundColor: "yellow" }}>
                    ...
                </ul>

    - This form of styling is NOT recommended
        - It makes the codebase hard to read and to maintain
        - It is considered a bad practice
        - ONLY to be used on special cases (i.e. troubleshooting styles) or as a last resort
