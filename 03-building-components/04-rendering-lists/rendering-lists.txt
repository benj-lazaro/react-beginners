Rendering Lists
---------------
- To render a list dynamically in JSX
    - Use the method array.map()
        - To each each item as individual JSX elements

    - Pass a callback arrow function as argument value to .map()
        - To iterate each item of the array

            <array_name>.map((<array_item>) => {
                <JSX_element> <array_item> </JSX_element>
            });

    - Insert the code into the returned JSX element within a pair of { } 

        { <array_name>.map((<array_item>) => {
            <JSX_element> <array_item> </JSX_element>
        }) };

    - Save changes and check browser

    - The broswer's JavaScript console reports the following warning:

        Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop

        - Reference (https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key)


- To add a unique key prop (property) that uniquely identifies each array item
    - React NEEDS this to keep track of each item
        - For adding or removing items dynamically
        - In order for React to know which part of the page should be updated

    - Think of the "key" property as an attribute to the JSX element

    - For the presented example
        - Each item in the array is a unique string
        - So this will be used (assigned) as the unique key for each item

    - On real-world application using APIs
        - More often, each item has a property like "id"
