Conditional Rendering
---------------------
- To dynamically render content based on certain conditions
    - Use an "if" statement or "ternary" operator

    - Alternatively, use a logical AND operator 
        - If the condition of the 1st operand is true
            - It returns the value of the 2nd operand
            
            - Otherwise, the result of the entire expression is false
                - Nothing will be rendered on the web page

        - NOTE: This is a common technique to render dynamic content
