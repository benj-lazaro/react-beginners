State vs Props
--------------
- The differences and similarities between State and Props are as follows:
    - Props (Properties)
        - Input (arguments) passed to a component
        
        - Similar to function arguments

        - It is immutable (unchangeable)
        
        - Anytime a change is introduced in the props
            - React re-renders the component 
            - Updates the virtual DOM accordingly 
        

    - State
        - Internal data managed by a component
            - That contains data that changes over time

        - Similar to local variables inside a function
        
        - It is mutable (changes over time)
        
        - Anytime a change is introduced in the state
            - React re-renders the component 
            - Updates the virtual DOM accordingly
