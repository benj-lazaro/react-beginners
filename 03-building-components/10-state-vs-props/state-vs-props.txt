State vs Props
--------------
- The difference between Props and State
    - Props (Properties)
        - These are "inputs" passed to a component

        - They are like function arguments

        - Treat props as immutable (unchangeable or as READ-ONLY)
            - Assigning a new value to a prop should NEVER be done within a component
            
            - Doing so is considered Anti-Pattern in React
                - Based on the functional programming principles

    - State
        - Refers to the internal data managed by a component

        - They are like local variables inside a function

        - A state is mutable 
            - It informs React that a component has data that can change over time


- The similarities of Props and State
    - Anytime a change is introduced in either props or state

    - React re-renders the component and updates the virtual DOM accordingly
