Fragments
---------
- In React, a component is NOT ALLOWED to return more than one JSX element
    - There are two ways to solve this problem
        - Wrapping the multiple JSX elements w/in a pair of <div> elements
            - However this adds one extra element in the DOM just to make React happy
            - This is unnecessary

        - Use a Fragment
            - Similar to wrapping multiple JSX elements w/in a pair of <div> elements
            - EXCEPT it does NOT render an extra element in the DOM


- To import Fragments into a component
    - Use the "import" statement
    - To specifically import "Fragment" from the React library
    
        import { Fragment } from "react";


- To implement Fragments on a multiple JSX elements
    -  Wrap the multiple JSX elements w/in a pair of <Fragment> elements

        <Fragment>
            {/* Multiple JSX elements here */}
        </Fragment>


- An alternative implement
    - Remove the recently defined "import" statement
    
    - Omit the word "Fragment" 
        - Leaving behind an empty <> tags

        - Informs the React library to a Fragment
            - On the enclosed multiple JSX elements

        <>
            {/* Multiple JSX elements here */}
        </>
