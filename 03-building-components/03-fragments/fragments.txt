Fragments
---------
- A React component is NOT ALLOWED to return more than one (1) JSX element
    - Two (2) ways to address this concern
        - Wrap multiple JSX elements w/in a pair of JSX <div> elements
            - However this adds an extra JSX element in the DOM in order to make React "happy"
            - This is NOT necessary

        - Use a Fragment to wrap the multiple JSX elements
            - This approach does NOT render an extra JSX element in the DOM
            - Preferred approach


- To import Fragment into a React component
    - Declare an "import" statement and specifically pull "Fragment" from the React library
    
        import { Fragment } from "react";


- To implement multiple JSX elements in a Fragment
    - Wrap the elements w/in <Fragment>

        <Fragment>
            {/* Multiple JSX elements here */}
        </Fragment>


- Alternatively, Fragment can be implmented without explicitly importing it
    - Delete the previously declared "import" statement
    - Remove the word "Fragment" & leave the <> </> tags behind
    - This implicitly informs React that the multiple JSX elements are wrapped in a Fragment

        <>
            {/* Multiple JSX elements here */}
        </>
