Fragments
---------
- A React component is NOT ALLOWED to return more than one (1) JSX element
    - Two (2) ways to address this concern
        - Wrap multiple JSX elements w/in a pair of JSX <div> elements
            - However this adds an extra JSX element into the DOM to make React "happy"
            - This is NOT necessary

        - Use a React library's Fragment and wrap the multiple JSX elements inside it
            - This approach does NOT render an extra JSX element in the DOM
            - This is the preferred approach


- To import Fragment into the React component
    - Declare an "import" statement
    - Specifically pull "Fragment" from the React library
    
        import { Fragment } from "react";


- To wrap the multiple elements in <Fragment>

    <Fragment>
        {/* Multiple JSX elements here */}
    </Fragment>


- Alternatively, Fragment can be used without importing it from the library
    - Delete the previously declared "import" statement
    - Remove the word "Fragment", leaving the pair of opening & closing < > behind
    - Implicitly informs React that the multiple JSX elements are wrapped inside a Fragment

            {/* Multiple JSX elements here */}
