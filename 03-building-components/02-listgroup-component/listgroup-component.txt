- To create a new React component named "ListGroup"
    - Open the folder named "src"

    - Create a new folder named "components"
        - By convention, all React components will be placed here

    - Open the folder named "components"
    
    - Create a new file named "ListGroup.tsx"
        - This is the source file of the <ListGroup /> component

    - Open the file named "ListGroup.tsx"

    - Declare a function named "ListGroup()"

    - Inside the function
        - Declare a "return" statement that returns a JSX element <h1>
        - The JSX element <h1> contains the string "Hi World"

            function ListGroup() {
                return (
                    <h1>Hi World</h1>
                );
            }

    - The line suceeding the function "ListGroup()" block
        - Declare an "export" statement 
        - Export the function "ListGroup()" as a "default object" from this module

            export default ListGroup;


- To import the created component <ListGroup /> into the Vite-generated React application
    - Open the file named "App.tsx"

    - Declare a new "import" statement
        - To import the default object "ListGroup" from the module located at "./components/ListGroup"
        - Remove the previous "import" statement for the component <Message />

            import ListGroup from "./components/ListGroup";       

    - On the "return" statement of the function "App()"
        - Replace the component <Message /> with <ListGroup />

            function App() {
                return (
                    <div>
                    <ListGroup />
                    </div>
                );
            }

    - Save the changes
        - The browser displays the content "Hi World"
        - Replacing the <Message /> component's "Hello World"


- To implement Bootstrap's own "List Group" component in the React component <ListGroup />
    - Copy Bootstrap's "List Group" component's HTML mark-up 
        - Reference (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/list-group/)

    - Open the file "ListGroup.tsx"

    - Delete the JSX <h1> element from the "return" statement

    - Paste Bootstrap's HTML mark-up
        - Rename the HTML attribute "class" to "className"

        function ListGroup() {
            return (
                <ul className="list-group">
                <li className="list-group-item">An item</li>
                <li className="list-group-item">A second item</li>
                <li className="list-group-item">A third item</li>
                <li className="list-group-item">A fourth item</li>
                <li className="list-group-item">And a fifth one</li>
                </ul>
            );
        }

    - Save the changes
        - The browser displays nicely formatted list of items
