Getting Optimized Images
------------------------
- The images of the games retrieved from RAWG API are pretty big
    - Users with slow connection
        - Loading the page will take some time to complete

    - Getting optimized images are considered
        - To speed up the page load (i.e. loading time)

    - The RAWG API offers cropping images on-the-fly by modifying the image's URL
        - Inserting the "crop" right after "media/"
        - Followed by the targeted dimension (width/height) of the image

    - The logic that will handle the modification of the video game's image URL
        - Will be placed on a separate service
    

- In the project code
    - In the folder "src/services"
        - Create a new file named "image-url.ts"

    - In the file "image-url.ts"
        - Define an anonymous arrow function
            - Save it in a constant named "getCroppedImageUrl"

        - In the arrow function
            - It takes a parameter variable named "url"
            - It is of data type "string"

        - Export the function "getCroppedImageUrl" as a default object from this module

            const getCroppedImageUrl = (url: string) => {};

            export default getCroppedImageUrl;

        
        - In the body of the arrow function
            - Create a constant named "target"
                - Assign the string "media/" as value

            - Create a constant named "index"
                - Call the method ".indexOf()" on the parameter variable "url"
                    - Pass the constant "target" as argument value
                
                - Chain the property ".length" on the constant "target"
                    - Using "+" operator

            const target = "media/";
            const index = url.indexOf(target) + target.length;

            
            - To insert the word "crop" into the value stored in the parameter variable "url"
                - Call the method ".slice()"
                    - Pass the starting index of 0
                    - Then pass the constant "index" as the end index

                - Followed by the string value "crop/600/400/"

                - Then calling the method ".slice()" again on the parameter variable "url"
                    - To add the remaining URL of the video game's image

                - Return the modified URL by prefixing the statement with the keyword "return"
            
            return url.slice(0, index) + "crop/600/400/" + url.slice(index);
        

    - Open the component <GameCard /> (GameCard.tsx)
        - In the component <Image /> property "src"
        
        - Pass the object "game.background_image" as an argument value to the function getCroppedImageUrl()

            <Image src={getCroppedImageUrl(game.background_image)} />

 
        - Save the changes
            - Vite reloads the React application

            - To verify the dimensions of the game's images
                - Launch Chrome Dev Tools
                    - Click the tab "Network"
                    - Click the button "Img"
                
                - Select & double-click any of the image
                    - A new tab will be opened
                    - Loads the resized image
