Building for Production
-----------------------
- Prior to deploying an application for production
    - First, it has to be built locally (via terminal or VS Code command palette)
        - It is faster & easier to discovery & fix errors respectively

    - To build locally (via terminal)

        npm run build

    
    - NOTE: The warning "Some chunks are larget than 500kbBs after minification"
        - This is due to the bundle "index-<characters>.js is > 500kBs
        - Bundle optimization will be addressed on the following section

    
    - To build via VS Code command palette (CTRL + SHIFT + P)
        - Type "build"
        - Select "Tasks: Run Build Task" (CTRL + SHIFT + B)
        - Select "npm: build tsc && vite build"
        - A terminal window opens and performs the same tasks as building via terminal

    - After the build
        - A new folder is created named "dist" (i.e. distributable)
        - Contains the app's assets (i.e. images), CSS, HTML & JavaScript files
        - Contents of this folder will be deployed for production
