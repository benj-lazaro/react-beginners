Building the Navigation Bar
---------------------------
- Build the basic layout for the project's Navigation Bar
    - Remove the previous "test" code

    - Add the application's logo into the Navigation Bar


- In the project code
    - In the folder "src"
        - Create a new folder named "components"

    - Inside the folder "components"
        - Create a new file named "NavBar.tsx"

    - Inside the file "NavBar.tsx"
        - Use the shortcut "rafce"
            - To generate the corresponding component function code

        - Replace the JSX element <div> with the Chakra UI component <HStack>
            - This is to layout items (to be added) in the Navigation Bar horizontally

            - Type "<HStack" followed by a Tab to generate the corresponding "import" statement
       
            - Then remove the generated "import" statement for react

                import { HStack } from '@chakra-ui/react'

                const NavBar = () => {
                    return (
                        <HStack>
                    
                        </HStack>
                    )
                }


        - Add the component <Image /> as content to <HStack>
            - Include the component in the "import" statement

                import { HStack, Image } from "@chakra-ui/react";

                const NavBar = () => {
                    return (
                        <HStack>
                            <Image />
                        </HStack>
                    );
                };


        - Import the application's logo (logo.webp) as an object using an "import" statement

                import logo from "../assets/logo.webp";

            - NOTE: .webp images are highly optimized images for the web


        - Back to the component <Image />
            - Declare the property "src"
            - Assign the imported object "logo" as value

                const NavBar = () => {
                    return (
                        <HStack>
                            <Image src={logo} />
                        </HStack>
                    );
                };


        - Save the changes
            - Next is to add the <NavBar /> component (NavBar.tsx) to the <App /> component


    - Open the <App /> component (App.tsx)
        - On the <GridItem /> component with the string content "Nav"

        - Replace the string content "Nav" with a <NavBar /> component

            <GridItem area="nav" bg="coral">
                <NavBar />
            </GridItem>

        - Save the changes
            - Vite reloads the React application

            - Renders the application logo on the Navigation Bar
                - The rendered logo is way too large

        
        - To address this concern
            - Switch back to the component <NavBar /> (NavBar.tsx)

            - On the component <Image />
                - Declare the property "boxSize"
                - Assign the "60px" as value

                <Image src={logo} boxSize="60px" />


            - Save the changes
                - Vite reloads the React application

                - The size of the logo image is now resized appropriately


        - Add a component <Text /> right after the <Image />
            - Assign the string content "NavBar"

                import { HStack, Image, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react";
                import logo from "../assets/logo.webp";

                const NavBar = () => {
                    return (
                        <HStack>
                            <Image src={logo} boxSize="60px" />
                            <Text>NavBar</Text>
                        </HStack>
                    );
                };


            - Save the changes
                - Vite reloads the React application
                
                - The text "NavBar" is rendered (horizontally) right after the application's image logo


    - Switch back to the <App /> component
        - Remove the initial background color of "coral"" 
            - From the corresponding <GridItem /> component

            <GridItem area="nav">
                <NavBar />
            </GridItem>


        - Save the changes
            - Vite reloads the React application
            
            - The previous background color of the Navigation Bar has now been removed
