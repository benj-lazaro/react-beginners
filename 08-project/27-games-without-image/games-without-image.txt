Handling Games Without An Image
-------------------------------
- To address the recent implemented workaround
    - On games that didn't come with a preview Image
    
    - Using a default image placeholder
        - An image file (no-image-placeholder.webp)
        - That came with the project's startup files

    - Copy the image file to the folder "src/assets"


- On the project code
    - Open that custom service "image-url.ts"

    - Import the image file using the alias "noImage"

        import noImage from "../assets/no-image-placeholder.webp"


    - Save the changes
        - Vite reloads the React application

        - Sort the video games in the Main area by name
            - Video games without images are now rendered with a placeholder image
