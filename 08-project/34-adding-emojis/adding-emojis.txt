Adding Emojis
-------------
- Add emojis to the rendered game cards in the Main area


- On the project code
    - Open the custom hook "useGames.ts"

    - On the interface "Game"
        - Add a new property named "rating_top"
            - Assign the data type of number
        
        - NOTE: The property "rating_top" is a whole number
            - Rendered emojis will be dependent on the assigned number value of this property
    
            export interface Game {
                id: number;
                name: string;
                background_image: string;
                parent_platforms: { platform: Platform }[];
                metacritic: number;
                rating_top: number;
            }
