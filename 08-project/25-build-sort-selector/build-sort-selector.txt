Building Sort Selector
----------------------
- Next is to implement a drop-down list for sorting the games in the Main area
    - This section focused on implementing the component
    - NOT the sorting mechanism


- In the project code
    - In the folder "src/component"
        - Create a new file named "SortSelector.tsx"

        - The <SortSelector /> component is very similar to that of the <PlatformSelector />
            - To save time copy the "return" statement of the said component 

    - Open <PlatformSelector /> component (PlatformSelector.tsx)
        - Copy the component's "return" statement

    - Switch back to the <SortSelector /> component
        - Select the component's "return" statement
            - Then paste the copied codebase

        - Import the corresponding components from the Chakra UI library
            - In order to address the TypeScript compilation errors

        - For the <MenuButton /> component
            - Replace the existing content with a string "Order by: Relevance"

        - For the <MenuList /> component
            - Replace the existing <MenuItem /> component
            - With six (6) static <MenuItem /> components with the corresponding content
                - Relevance
                - Date added
                - Name
                - Release date
                - Popularity
                - Average rating 

            return (
                <Menu>
                    <MenuButton as={Button} rightIcon={<BsChevronDown />}>
                        Order by: Relevance
                    </MenuButton>
                    <MenuList>
                        <MenuItem>Relevance</MenuItem>
                        <MenuItem>Date added</MenuItem>
                        <MenuItem>Name</MenuItem>
                        <MenuItem>Release date</MenuItem>
                        <MenuItem>Popularity</MenuItem>
                        <MenuItem>Average rating</MenuItem>
                    </MenuList>
                </Menu>
            );


        - Remove the "import" statement for React

            import React from "react";


        - Save the changes
            - Next is to import the <SortSelector /> to the <App /> component


    - Open the <App /> component (App.tsx)
        - Insert the <SortSelector /> in-between the <PlatformSelector /> & <GameGrid /> components

            <GridItem area="main">
                <PlatformSelector
                selectedPlatform={gameQuery.platform}
                onSelectPlatform={(platform) =>
                    setGameQuery({ ...gameQuery, platform })
                }
                />

                <SortSelector />
                
                <GameGrid gameQuery={gameQuery} />
            </GridItem>


        - Save the changes
            - Vite reloads the React application

            - The <SortSelector /> component is rendered on the DOM
                - It is rendered too close to the <PlatformSelector /> component
                - Needed to add space between the two components


        - Place both the <PlatformSelector /> & <SortSelector /> components inside a <HStack /> component
            - Declare the property "spacing"
                - Assign the value of "5"
                - This is the provide some space in-between the <PlatformSelector /> & <SortSelector /> components

            - Declare the property "paddingLeft"
                - Assign the value of "2"
                - This is to align the <PlatformSelector /> component 
                    - With the left-hand column of the rendered list of video games in the Main area

            - Declare the property "marginBottom"
                - Assign the value of "5"
                - This is to provide some space between the rendered components & the list in the Main area

            <HStack spacing={5} paddingLeft={2} marginBottom={5}>
                <PlatformSelector
                    selectedPlatform={gameQuery.platform}
                    onSelectPlatform={(platform) =>
                    setGameQuery({ ...gameQuery, platform })
                    }
                />

                <SortSelector />
            </HStack>


        - Save the changes
            - Vite reloads the React application
            
            - Both <PlatformSelector /> & <SortSelector /> components
                - Are properly spaced from each other
                - As well as from the rendered list of video games in the Main area
