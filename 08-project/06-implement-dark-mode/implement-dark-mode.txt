Implementing the Dark Mode
--------------------------
- To implement the Dark Mode on the project application
    - This is done using Chakra UI's "Color Mode"
    
    - To customize the default theme (i.e. "light") that comes with Chakra UI

    - Reference (https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/color-mode)


- In the project code
    - In the folder "src"
        - Create a new file named "theme.ts"

    - Inside the file "theme.ts"
        - Import the function named "extendTheme" 
        - Import the interface named "ThemeConfig"
            - From the Chakra UI library

        import { extendTheme, ThemeConfig } from "@chakra-ui/react";

    - Create a configuration object named "config"
        - Annotate it with interface "ThemeConfig"
            - Save it as a constant

        - Assign an empty object

        - Inside the object
            - Declare the property "initialColorMode"
            - Assign a string value of "dark"

            const config: ThemeConfig = {
                initialColorMode: "dark"
            };
        

        - Call the function "extendTheme()"
            - Pass the configuration object "config" as an argument value
            - Save the returned color theme into a constant named "theme"

            const theme = extendTheme({config});


        - Export the constant "theme"
            - As a default JavaScript object from this module

            export default theme;


    - Open the file "main.tsx"
        - On the line AFTER the "import" statement for the "App"
            - Import the object "theme" from the file "theme.ts"

            ...
            import App from "./App";
            import theme from "./theme";
            ...

        
        - In the component <ChakraProvider />
            - Declare the property "theme"
            - Assign the object "theme" as value

            <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
            ...
            </ChakraProvider>


        - Before the component <App />
            - Add a new component named "<ColorModeScript />

            - Declare the property "initialColorMode"
                - Assign the object "theme.config.initialColorMode" as value

            <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
                <ColorModeScript initialColorMode={theme.config.initialColorMode} />
                <App />
            </ChakraProvider>

    
    - Save the changes
        - Vite reloads the Reach application

        - Refreshing the DOM
            - The color mode of the application remains light
            - Chakra UI stores the current Color Mode in the browser's local storage

    - To coax changes on the Color Mode
        - Launch Chrome's Dev Tools

        - Click the tab named "Application"
        
        - Expand the icon named "Local Storage"
        
        - Click the running "localhost:<port_number>"
            - Diplays the current value of the key "chakra-ui-color-mode"
            - Initially assigned with the value "light"

        - Delete the current key
            - Perform a right-mouse click
            - Select "Delete"

        - Refresh the browser
            - The Dark Mode is now the current Color Mode
        
        - Looking at the Local Storage again
            - The key "chakra-ui-color-mode" is now set to the value of "dark"
