Installing Chakra UI 
--------------------
- Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library
    - Provides the building blocks to build React applications
    - Website (https://v2.chakra-ui.com/)


- To install Chakra UI using Vite
    - Go to the website (https://v2.chakra-ui.com/)
    - Click the page "Getting Started"
    - Scroll down to the "Framework Guide"
    - Click the card "Vite"

    - To install dependencies via terminal

        npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion


- Setup the "CharkaProvider" at the root of the React application
    - Go the directory "src"

    - Open the file "main.tsx"

    - Copy the "import" statement for Chakra UI
        - Paste it right AFTER React import statements

        import React from "react";
        import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
        import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";

    - Wrap the <App /> component within the <ChakraProvider /> component
    
        ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
            <React.StrictMode>
                <ChakraProvider>
                    <App />
                </ChakraProvider>
            </React.StrictMode>
        )


- To ensure that Chakra UI is installed properly
    - Open the <App /> component (App.tsx)

    - Remove the Vite generated "import" statements
        - As well as code within the function "App()"

        function App() {

        }

        export default App


    - Import a button component from the Chakra UI library

        import { Button, ButtonGroup } from '@chakra-ui/react'


    - Search for the component "Button" on Chakra UI's website
        - Copy the code for Chakra UI's <Button /> component
        - Reference (https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/button/usage)


    - Inside the function "App()"
        - Add a "return" statement
        - Paste by the JSX element <button> copied from Chakra UI's website

        import { Button, ButtonGroup } from "@chakra-ui/react";

        function App() {
            return <Button colorScheme="blue">Button</Button>;
        }

        export default App;
    
    - Save the changes
        - Vite reloads the React application

        - A stylized button is rendered on the DOM
    
        - Clicking the button    
            - A dark Blue outline surrounds the button
            - This is due to the default styles implemented in Vite projects

        - To address this concern
            - Open the file "index.css"
            - Delete the entire content of the file

            - Save the changes
                - Vite reloads the React application

        - Clicking the button   
            - The dark Blue outline the surrounds the button is now gone

    - Chakra UI is now confirmed to be installed property
