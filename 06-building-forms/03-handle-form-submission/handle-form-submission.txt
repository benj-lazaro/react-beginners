Handling Form Submission
------------------------
- To handle form submissions 
    - Use the JSX mark-up attribute "onSubmit" in the <Form /> component
        - Assign / reference an Event Handlder to "onSubmit"

    - The Event Handlder accepts an "event" object as argument
        - By default, the form posts the data to a server
        - Then reloads the HTML document (along with the component(s))

        - To prevent this default behavior
            - Call the function event.preventDefault()
            - Within the Event Handlder
