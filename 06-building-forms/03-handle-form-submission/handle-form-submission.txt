Handling Form Submission
------------------------
- To handle form submissions
    - Use the property "onSubmit" on the React component
    - Then assign an Event Handler
        - This arrow function handles the form submission
        - After the user clicks the "Submit" button

    - By default, when a HTML form is submitted
        - The form data is posted (or submitted) to a remote server
        - Then the browser performs a fullpage reload
        - NOTE: This is the default behavior

    - To prevent the default behavior from being triggered
        - On the Event Handler
            - Declare a parameter variable named "event" of type "FormEvent"
            - This stores an "event" object 
            - Triggered (or sent from) when the user clicked the "Submit" button

        - Within the body of the Event Handler
            - Call the function "event.preventDefault()"


- In the example code
    - Open the <Form /> component (Form.tsx)

    - Declare the property "onSubmit" on the JSX element <form>
        - Assign the Event Handler (to be named) "handleSubmit"

            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                ...
            </form>

    - Outside the component's JSX mark-up
        - Declare an anonymous arrow function
        
        - Declare a parameter variable named "event" of type "FormEvent"
            - This variable stores the corresponding "event" object
            - Triggered (or sent from) when the user clicked the "Submit" button

        - Inside the arrow function
            - Call the function "event.preventDefault()"
                - Prevents submitting form data to a non-existent remote server
                - Prevents the fullpage reload after submittion

            - Declare a console.log() with the string content "Submitted"

        - Save the arrow function to a constant named "handleSubmit"

            const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent) => {
                event.preventDefault();
                console.log("Submitted.");
            };
        
    - Save the changes
        - Vite reloads the React application

        - When the user clicks the "Submit" button
            - The default behavior after submitting a HTML form is prevented
            - The message "Submitted" is returned on the browser's JavaScript console
