Disabling the Submit Button
---------------------------
- Last implementation for the section project
    - Disable the Submit button
    - When the data in the <Form /> component's fields are invalid
    - Implemented using React Form Hook's property "isValid"
    

- Open the <Form /> component (Form.tsx)
    - On the line code of that generates a form object using React Form Hook
    - Pull the property "isValid" from "fromState" object
    
        const Form = () => {

        const {
            register,
            handleSubmit,
            formState: { errors, isValid },
        } = useForm<FormData>({ resolver: zodResolver(schema) });
        ...
        }


- Move to the JSX mark-up <button>
    - Add the attribute "disabled"
    - Assign the object {!sValid} as value

        <button disabled={!isValid} className="btn btn-primary" type="submit">
            Submit
        </button>

    - Save changes and test the code
    

- The Submit button remains disabled when
    - The form fields are blank
    - The form fields are filled with data that violates the validation rules

    
- NOTE: It is observed that the property "isValid" from the React Form Hook
    - Prevents the custom error messages from appearing

    - The custom error messages ONLY appear
        - AFTER successfully submitting a set of correct data
        - THEN folllowed by an entry with errornous data that violates the validation rules
