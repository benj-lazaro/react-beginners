Building ExpenseList
--------------------
- Build the easiest component in the project
    - Under the folder "src"
        - Create a new folder named "expense-tracker"
        - This folder will contain all the building blocks for the Expense Tracker app

    - Inside the folder "expense-list"
        - Create a new folder named "components"

    - Inside the "components" folder
        - Create a new file "ExpenseList.tsx"
        - This component handles the
            - Rendering of each item (expense) passed as Props (properties)
            - Dynamically compute the total amount of the items

    - On the <App /> component
        - Import the <ExpenseList /> component

        - Defines the dummy data (array of objects) 
            - Passed as Props to the <ExpenseList /> component

        - Handles the deletion of items from the dummy data
            - Using State Hook
            - Filters the array of dummy data except the targeted one for deletion
