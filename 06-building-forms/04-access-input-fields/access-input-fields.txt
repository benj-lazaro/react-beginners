Accessing Input Fields
----------------------
- To access DOM elements (e.g. input fields)
    - Use the built-in React Hook called "useRef()"
    - It returns a reference object
        - The targeted DOM element


- Import the React Hook "useRef" in the <Form /> component

    import React, { FormEvent, useRef } from "react";


- To implement the React hook "useRef()"
    - Initially pass a "null" value as argument to useRef()
    - Save the returned reference object to a constant

        const nameRef = useRef(null);


- Inform the TypeScript compiler that useRef() is referencing an <input> element
    - Place "<HTMLInputElement>" in-between "useRef" and its ()

        const nameRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

    - NOTE: The "<HTMLInputElement>" is one of the standard interfaces defined in browsers
        - This represents an <input> element


- On the JSX mark-up <input>
    - Associate the React hook to the targeted <input> element
    - Using the attribute "ret"
    - Assign the associated constant variable

        <input ref={nameRef} id="name" type="text" className="form-control" />


- On the Event Handler
    - To access the value of the targeted <input> element
        - By referencing the associated constant
        - Then access the returned reference object's property named "current"
        - Finally, access the reference object's prperty named "value"

            console.log(nameRef.current.value);

    - NOTE: An <input> element has an attribute named "value"
        - Referencing the user provided input


- Repeat the aforementioned steps for each <input> field


- Create an object in the <Form /> component
    - Where the collected value(s) of <input> element(s) will be stored

        const person = { name: "", age: 0 };


- Refactor the Event Handler
    - Assign the collected <input> value to the correponding object property
    - Display the content of the object into the browser's JavaScript console

        if (nameRef.current !== null) person.name = nameRef.current.value;
        if (ageRef.current !== null) person.age = parseInt(ageRef.current.value);
